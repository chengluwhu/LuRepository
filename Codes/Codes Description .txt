there are mainly two parts in these codes, namely:
(1) Extracting feautre points
     In this part, firstly, we must extracte feature points containing valley points, ridge points , saddl points and mountain tops by importing original contour lines and the boundary of contours data.
    Secondly, we should use DCE(Discrete Curve Evolution) algorithm  to  filter feature points for well extracting feature lines by importing extracted feautre points in the first step and original contour lines.
    In the extracted results, the valley points were marked by -1, the ridge points were marked by 1, the saddle points were marked by 2 and the mountain tops were marked by 0.

(2)Extracting feature lines
     In this part, we extracted terrain feature lines by importing filtered feautre points and original contour lines. In the extracted results, the main valley lines  were marked by -1,  the first level branch valley lines were marked by -2, the second level branch valley lines were marked by -3, the minor valley lines were marked by -4, the mian ridge lines were marked by 1, the first level branch ridge lines were marked by 2 and the minor ridge lines were marked by 4 in the ¡°Code¡± property .
    After extracting, we can classfiy  the extraction terrain feature lines by using the ArcGIS software.
